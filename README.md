# rpconsole
Console version of RegiPro, an application and proof of concept that allows students at the University of Alabama to register/be notified when a class that is full gains an open slot.
The console version should only be used on mac. While the console version will work on windows, there may be stability and file reading issues that do not appear on mac, so it is recommended to use the windows gui version, which alleviates these issues.
